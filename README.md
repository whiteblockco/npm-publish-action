# npm-publish-action

GitHub action to automatically publish packages to npm.

## Usage

Create a new `.github/workflows/npm-publish.yml` file:

```yaml
name: npm-publish
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main # Change this to your default branch
jobs:
  npm-publish:
    name: npm-publish
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Publish if version has been updated
      uses: pascalgn/npm-publish-action@1.3.6
      with: # All of theses inputs are optional
        tag_name: "v%s"
        tag_message: "v%s"
        create_tag: "true"
        commit_pattern: "^Release (\\S+)"
        workspace: "."
        publish_command: "yarn"
        publish_args: "--non-interactive"
        build_command: "yarn build"
      env: # More info about the environment variables in the README
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # Leave this as is, it's automatically generated
        NPM_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_AUTH_TOKEN }} # You need to set this in your repo settings
```

Now, when someone changes the version in `package.json` to 1.2.3 and pushes a commit with the message `Release 1.2.3`, the `npm-publish` action will create a new tag `v1.2.3` and publish the package to the npm registry.

### Inputs

These inputs are optional: that means that if you don't enter them, default values will be used and it'll work just fine.

- `tag_name`: the name pattern of the new tag
- `tag_message`: the message pattern of the new tag
- `create_tag`: whether to create a git tag or not (defaults to `"true"`)
- `commit_pattern`: pattern that the commit message needs to follow
- `workspace`: custom workspace directory that contains the `package.json` file
- `publish_command`: custom publish command (defaults to `yarn`)
- `publish_args`: publish command arguments (for example `--prod --verbose`, defaults to empty)

### Environment variables

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: this is a token that GitHub generates automatically, you only need to pass it to the action as in the example
- `NPM_AUTH_TOKEN`: this is the token the action will use to authenticate to [npm](https://npmjs.com). You need to generate one in npm, then you can add it to your secrets (settings -> secrets) so that it can be passed to the action. DO NOT put the token directly in your workflow file.
